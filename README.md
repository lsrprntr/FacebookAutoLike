# FacebookGhettoAutoLike
Likes posts on group feed

Screen dimensions are set to my personal laptop.
Very dumb process, uses Ctrl+F finder

Starting on a facebook group page feed:
*finds the like button
*checks if its been liked already
*depending on answer likes it
*or continues to the next one
*refreshes the page

-counter of how many likes passed
-counter of how many failures to reset the above to zero
